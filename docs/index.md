## Introductory

Welcome to the Undertailor documentation, the official documentation site for the Undertailor project.

Undertailor is a brand new engine built specifically for the creation of Undertale-styled fangames, written in Java using the libGDX framework. The engine reads Lua scripts to create games, within maps created in Tiled.

!!! note
	Undertailor is still in an early development stage. Don't expect things to be shining and perfect!
